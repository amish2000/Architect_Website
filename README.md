The project begins with a landing page featuring an animated banner and a menu icon. Upon loading, the banner smoothly transitions from the bottom. The full-screen background image scales down with a transition effect. The menu icon, located at the top right corner, opens a sidebar when clicked, transforming into an X. Navigation items change color on hover, and social media icons appear at the bottom of the sidebar. The “About Us” section includes a heading, text, and icons, centered around a small house image using CSS Grid. Following that, the card section showcases three cards with a captivating hover effect, implemented using the Tilt.js JavaScript plugin. Finally, the contact section will be developed.
