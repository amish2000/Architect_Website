All right.

So it's time to move on and start to build the next project, which is going to be one of the biggest

one.

As usual, before we dive deeper into our project and start to build it.

At first, let's go ahead and describe it.

So if I reload the page, then we will get here.

The spinner.

It is displaying for a couple of seconds and after that the project is loaded.

The first thing that you see here is a landing page with an animated banner and the menu icon.

So once the project is displayed, the banner moves from the bottom with a nice and smooth transition.

Besides that, we have here an animated full screen background.

The scale of the image is decreasing with a transition.

All right.

So as I said, we have here the menu icon, which is placed at the top right corner.

If I click it, then the sidebar will display from the right side.

Also, the menu icon will transform into an X.

The navigation is going to be a kind of simple one, but we have here a nice and cool effect.

If I hover over the navigation items, then they will change their color from the left to right.

Besides that, we have here a couple of social media icons at the bottom of the sidebar with some hover

effects.

If I hover over the x closing button, then the tooltip will display with the text close.

And if I click the x, then the sidebar will close.

Okay, that's it about the landing and the sidebar.

Let's move on to the next section, which is going to be about us.

We have here the heading with an underline followed by some text and icons.

And in the center of this section we have a small image of the house.

This section is going to be built based on the CSS layout module called CSS Grid.

Next comes the card section.

We have here three cards with a nice and cool hover effect.

It is going to be created with one of the JavaScript plugins called Tilt dot JS.

So you'll be able to learn about how to use this plugin after the card section, we will build the contact

section.

As you can see, we have here the background image on the left side of this box.

As for the right side, there are a couple of elements.

I mean the heading, several inputs and the submit button.

Each of the input fields as its label.

And if I focus the input, then the label will move up with some transition.

This effect is really popular and commonly used today, so you'll be able to learn how to create it.

Right after the contact section, we will build this simple footer where we have the copyright text

and some social media icons.

So the one last thing that I want to mention here is this fixed yellow button with the up arrow icon.

If I click it, then the page will scroll up smoothly till the top.

All right.

So the project is going to be responsive to all different screen sizes.

If I inspect the page, then switch to the responsive mode and check the project on different screen

sizes.

Then you will find that it is responsive and looks good.

As usual, I want to remind you one thing.

The project is built based on the desktop first approach and we build it on the larger screen size.

I mean the screen size with 1920 pixels of width and 1080 pixels of height.

So if you're using a relatively smaller screen size, then the project might not look good during the

the lectures, but that's not a problem.

Eventually we will make it responsive.

In the meantime, you can use the responsive mode and set the width to 1920 pixels and the height to

1080 pixels and work like so.
